# Things to do

### [01-05-2023]

- [ ] Use Chunks as data instead of writing it directly
- [ ] send data on the go with chunk length instead of sending it at the end
- [ ] take input as buffer don't encode/decode with utf-8 because utf 8 is a text conversion
- [ ] make use of the content-type header to determine what type it needs to be converted to
- [ ] use the sockets only in index.js don't send it as params to response instead send request as params to response
- [ ] make it such that it can also recieve data(and headers in chunks as well)
- [ ] google "rfc http" for finding the offical docs on http implementation
